# Lab 10 - Stacks and Queues

*Author: Paul M Rest*

----

### Description

A class library project containing a Stack and Queue class, with the Node class used by both. The Node class here can only hold string values.

For the Stack class:
- Can `Push()` a string onto a Stack (encapsulated in a Node)
- Can `Pop()` the top Node off the Stack and return its string value
- Can `Peek()` at the top Node's value without affecting the Stack
- Can check if Stack `IsEmpty()`

For the Queue class:
- Can `Enqueue()` a string on the queue (encapsulated in a Node)
- Can `Dequeue()` the front Node from the queue, and return its string value
- Can `Peek()` at the front Node's value without affecting the queue
- Can check if queue `IsEmpty()`
