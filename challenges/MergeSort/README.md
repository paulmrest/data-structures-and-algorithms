# Challenge 27: Merge Sort

An implementation of merge sort, along with a walk-through of the algorithm using a sample input, and a high level description of how the algorithm works.

- `MergeSort(int[] array)` - sorts an array of integers in place.

## Approach & Efficiency

- `MergeSort(int[] array)`
    - Time: O(n log n)
    - Space: O(n)

## Solution

[Description of Merge Sort](Blog.md)

## Link(s) to Code

[MergeSort.cs](MergeSort/MergeSortClass.cs)

## Change Log
