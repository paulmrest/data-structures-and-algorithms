# Challenge 26: Insertion Sort

An implementation of insertion sort, along with a walk-through of the algorithm using a sample input, and a high level description of how the algorithm works.

- `InsertionSort(int[] intArray)` - sorts an array of integers in place.

## Approach & Efficiency

- `InsertionSort(int[] intArray)`
    - Time: O(n^2)
    - Space: O(1)

## Solution

[Description of Insertion Sort](Blog.md)

## Link(s) to Code

[InsertionSortClass.cs](InsertionSort/InsertionSortClass.cs)

## Change Log
